# CUHKSZ CSC4180 2024Spring

Hello everyone, welcome to take the course CSC4180: Compiler Construction offered by The Chinese University of HongKong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ). In this course, you are going to learn the fundamental basics of compiler and get a hands-on exercise implementing your own compiler for both the Micro language and the simple C language grammar. This course mainly covers the compiler front-end and only gives a very brief introduction to the back-end. To keep our course content up-to-date, LLVM is introduced and you need to build the front-end that finally generates LLVM IR, and then use the LLVM backend to do the optimization and code generation.

## Six Compiler Phases

The first four are called compiler front-end, while the last two are called compiler back-end.

1. Scanning (Lexical Analysis)
2. Parsing (Syntactic Analysis)
3. Semantic Analysis
4. Intermediate Code Generation
5. Optimization
6. Code Generation
