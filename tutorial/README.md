# Environment Setup

Since our cluster does not have a RISC-V CPU, we have to create a RISC-V64-QEMU docker container to enable you to execute RISC-V programs. Everyone is supposed to receive an email about your username and password. Please follow the instructions given in the email to log in to the cluster docker container and have a try with the Clang-LLVM tutorial to get a hands-on experience on what each compiler phase does and outputs.

## Tutorials

- Clang-LLVM (Phase-by-Phase Instruction): [Here](./Clang-LLVM.md)
- SSH login without password: [Here](./SSH-login-without-password.md)
