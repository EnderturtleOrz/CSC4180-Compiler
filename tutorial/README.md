# Environment Setup

Since our cluster does not have RISC-V CPU, we have to create a RISC-V64-QEMU docker container to enable you to execute RISC-V programs. Everyone is supposed to receive an email about your username and password. Please follow the instruction given in the email to login the cluster docker container and have a try with the Clang-LLVM tutorial to get a hands-on experience on what does each compiler phase do and output.
